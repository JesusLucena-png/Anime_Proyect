A woman with a piercing gaze, gray eyes, and black hair tied in a ponytail. She wears a tight black military uniform, built for stealth and agility. In her hands, she wields two black daggers, sharp as the night. Her presence exudes dark elegance, surrounded by a shadowy aura that subtly ripples around her. Beside her, a group of humanoid shadows silently escort her, as if they were extensions of her own will. She is the embodiment of stealth, darkness, and unseen danger.
